This project uses a deep learning model to generate descriptive captions for images. It combines a pre-trained CNN for image feature extraction with an LSTM network for caption generation. The entire application is wrapped in a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.

## ✨ Features

* **CNN-LSTM Architecture**: Utilizes the Xception model as a CNN encoder to extract image features and an LSTM network as a decoder to generate text sequences.
* **Interactive Web App**: A simple and intuitive web interface (`app.py`) built with Streamlit to upload an image and instantly get a caption.
* **End-to-End Training**: Includes a complete script (`main.py`) to preprocess the dataset, extract features, and train the model from scratch.
* **Command-Line Inference**: Provides a script (`test.py`) to test the model on a single image directly from the terminal.
* **Setup Diagnostics**: A handy utility (`diagnostic.py`) to verify that all required files and model assets are correctly placed.

## 🔧 Model Architecture

The model uses a classic encoder-decoder framework, which is a popular choice for image captioning tasks.

1.  **Encoder (Image Feature Extractor)**: A pre-trained **Xception** model (trained on ImageNet) acts as the encoder. It processes the input image and outputs a 2048-dimensional feature vector, which serves as a rich numerical representation of the image's content.

2.  **Decoder (Language Model)**: An **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) network acts as the decoder. It takes the image feature vector and the sequence of previously generated words to predict the next word in the caption. The process begins with a special `start` token and continues generating words one by one until an `end` token is predicted.

The model architecture, generated by the training script, looks like this:

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name
````

### 2\. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3\. Install Dependencies

Create a `requirements.txt` file with the content below and install the packages.

```
streamlit
numpy
matplotlib
Pillow
tensorflow
tqdm
```

Then, run the installation command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4\. Download the Dataset

The model is trained on the **Flickr8k dataset**.

  * Download the dataset from a source like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k).
  * Extract the contents and place the two resulting folders, `Flicker8k_Dataset` (images) and `Flickr8k_text` (text files), into the root of the project directory.

## 💡 How to Use

You can either use a pre-trained model or train one from scratch.

### Option A: Train the Model from Scratch

1.  **Check Paths**: The `main.py` script contains hardcoded paths for the dataset folders (`dataset_text` and `dataset_images`). Make sure these paths are correct for your system.
2.  **Run the Training Script**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    This script will:
      * Extract image features and save them to `features.p`.
      * Process text data and create `descriptions.txt` and `tokenizer.p`.
      * Train the model and save the weights (`.h5` files) in the `models2/` directory.

### Option B: Use a Pre-trained Model

1.  **Get Files**: You need the pre-trained model weights (`model_9.h5`) and the tokenizer (`tokenizer.p`). If you trained the model yourself, these files will be generated automatically. Otherwise, you'll need to download them.
2.  **Run Diagnostic Check**: Before launching the app, run the diagnostic tool to ensure all files are correctly located.
    ```bash
    python diagnostic.py
    ```
3.  **Launch the Streamlit App**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    Navigate to the local URL displayed in your terminal to use the app.

### Testing from the Command Line

To generate a caption for a single image from your terminal:

```bash
python test.py --image "path/to/your/image.jpg"
```

```
```
